USC IYA Web Development Team Project

Max, Paige, Isabella, Jake, and Calvin

## Content Requirements for your site:
This build will contain the majority of the primary content pages of the site, laid out and with the final design implemented. More interactive elements may be static (not yet scripted), but this should represent the majority of the traditional content of the site. You will be allowed to add more content after this build, but this assignment will be graded according to the requirements below:
1. This build of the site must have a minimum of 6 pages. It should have a distinct and consistent design, from color scheme to appearance, across pages.
2. The Homepage should contain an intro or overview of the site's focus/purpose, as well as a navigation that reflects most of the pages/content from the site map (not every page has to be built)
3. This website can be designed either a phone/small device or for a larger screen computer. BUT, it should still adapt to the other format (using media queries).
4. Besides the main/Homepage of the site with core highlights of the project, the Content Build must also include 5 or more of the pages/modules from the final site. This must include the website "Team" or "About Us" page that lists out each member of the team, including for eaxh member:
   a. Name
   b. Picture
   c. Short bio and/or general skills of that team member
   d. List of the intended team roles/contribution (html and css, graphic design production, javascript and coding, project managerment and q/a, etc.)

The completed site should be hosted on the iyaserver web space of one of the group members. Just one of you needs to submit the URL through Brightspace (for grading/credit). It is recommended your team use a source control platform like github to compile the build (and let each of you have your own copy of the updated files/site).

When evaluating your content builds, some questions or items to think about for your sites:
1. Consistency: Does the site have a consistent look and feel and design? Do all the pages feel like they belong to the same site?
2. Navigation: Is the nav easy to understand and use? Can you get around between pages? Does it fairly accurately represent the scope of the site?
3. Content: Does the site have actual, useful content (only limited/select places should have placeholder content)? Is it well presented? Some sites may be heavier in graphics rather than text, with heavy uses of photos and galleries, although all sites should have narrative text in them.
